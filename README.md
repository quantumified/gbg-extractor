# GBG Extractor
A Chrome extension made to extract GBG sector data and parse it into readable format. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/quantumified/gbg-extractor/releases). Keep in mind this is still in early development so expect bugs and issues.

This project makes use of FoE-Helper's open source code to function, which is licensed under APGL. It is basically a fork of foe-helper at this point, hopefully I can remove non-essential parts of it in future so it can be run as an addon to foehelper, instead of replacing your foe helper instance.
